              p.float-text Nestled in Worthing’s stunning Beach House Park, Palm Court Pavilion is a stylish, beautifully renovated café-bistro in the park’s Old Pavilion. Located just minutes from the town centre and the seafront, we serve delicious homemade food and offer a range of options for functions and events.
              p.float-text The caf&eacute; marks an exciting new chapter in the Pavilion’s history. After some years in disuse, the old Pavilion building has been given a brand new lease of life with a sympathetic renovation emphasising natural light inside, while taking advantage of the lovely open-air spaces of the surrounding park outside.
